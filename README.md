# mw-recipes

I got fed up with digging through shitty recipe websites so I decided to make a no-bullshit printer friendly collection.

A few of these recipes require an instant pot or some form of pressure cooker but a crock will suffice given enough time.

Also included are several links to external sites provided they are not riddled with ads or behind paywalls.
