## Notes
- The tomatoes should be whole peeled. Hand crush them when assembling the initial mix.
- The pepper flakes are flexible, 1 teaspoon is for those of weak constitution - i put a heaping tablespoon when making it for myself, and around 2 teaspoons when having company over.
- The 9-12 cloves of garlic is not wrong but I usually just use a whole bulb, however many cloves that is.
- I usually use medium or large shells for the pasta, but things like ziti / penne / rigatoni are likely just fine too.
- Depending on the night I will add cheese to the situation thusly: 1lb low moisture mozzarella cut into 15-20mm cubes, add half of it plus a substantial grating of parmigiano reggiano about 10min before end of bake (pasta should be nearly done) and stir to combine, then add the remaining half of the mozzarella and more parm a couple minutes before end of bake, stir to combine, grate even more parm on the top for good measure before finishing out the baking process.  This method is intended to have cheese throughout the dish in various vein and node sizes, hence the multiple addition stages.
- This recipe is really really good as leftovers and reheats nicely.
