## Ingredients
- 3 onions
- 1 1/2 carrots
- 3 Yukon gold potatoes (Tip: Russet potatoes would break down too easily)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp ginger
- 1 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (you can also use pork or beef chuck roast; don't use beef stew meat as it won't get tender)
- 1/8 tsp kosher or sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- 1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.) (for cooking)
- 3 cups Chicken Stock/Broth (homemade or store bought) (you can use beef stock for beef, or vegetable stock/broth; for a lower-sodium option, you can use water, or half stock and half water)
- 1 package Japanese curry roux (7-8 oz or 200-230 g for 6 servings; or use my Homemade Curry Roux)
- 1 Tbsp ketchup (read the blog post for add-on condiments)
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce (read the blog post for add-on condiments)
- Fukujinzuke (red pickled daikon)
- White short-grain rice

## Instructions
1. Cut the onions in half and cut each half into 5 wedges.
2. Peel the carrots and cut into bite-sized pieces. I use a Japanese cutting technique called “rangiri.” Cut the carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter turn between cuts. This not only results in an attractive shape that is good for stews and simmered dishes, it also gives the pieces more surface area to absorb seasonings quicker. Tip: You can cut the vegetables slightly bigger to avoid a mushy texture.
3. Peel the potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water to remove the starch.
4. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger.
5. Cut the meat into large bite-sized pieces (I use a Japanese cutting technique called “sogigiri”). Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
6. Press the Sauté button on your Instant Pot (I use a 6 QT Instant Pot) or preheat a stovetop pressure cooker over medium heat. When the pot is hot, add 1 Tbsp oil.
7. Add the sliced onions, minced garlic, and ginger.
8. Add the chicken to the pot and mix until just coated with oil.
9. Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot and mix well.
10. Add the chicken broth and use a spatula to press down the meat and vegetables into the liquid. Then, place the curry roux blocks (I combine 1/2 mild and 1/2 medium spicy packaged roux) on top of the other ingredients and DO NOT MIX! Otherwise, the roux may sink to the bottom of the pot and burn while cooking. If you use non-solidified homemade roux (that you just made), add it after pressure cooking is done. If you're using solidified homemade roux, place the cubes on top of the ingredients and do not mix.
11. Cover and lock the lid. Make sure the Instant Pot's steam release handle points to Sealing and not Venting. Press the Keep Warm/Cancel button on the Instant Pot to stop sautéing. Then, press the Meat/Stew button to switch to pressure cooking. Press the "minus" button to change the cooking time to 15 minutes.
12. When it is finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the Keep Warm mode. Slide the steam release handle to Venting to let out steam until the float valve drops down, OR let the pressure release naturally (this takes about 15 minutes).
13. Unlock the lid. (If you're using homemade curry roux, add it to the pot now and heat on Sauté mode for an additional 5 minutes until the roux is well blended into the stew.) Add the ketchup and soy sauce. Mix well, checking one last time that all the curry roux has dissolved.

## Notes
- Serve over rice and garnish with Fukujinzuke.
- A bit of corn starch can be used as a thickener at the end. It tends to thicken quite a bit as it cools anyway so use cornstarch sparingly.
