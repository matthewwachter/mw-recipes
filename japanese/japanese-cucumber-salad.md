## Ingredients
- 2 Japanese or Persian cucumbers
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed (2 g dried, 20-30 g after rehydration for 4 servings)
- 1/2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
- 4 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned)
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- 1/2 tsp soy sauce (use GF soy sauce for gluten free)

## Instructions
1. In a bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and soy sauce. Whisk well together. If the vinegar tastes too strong, you can dilute it with a very small amount of dashi (Japanese soup stock) or water.
2. Soak the dried wakame seaweed in water and let it rehydrate for 10 minutes.
3. Peel the skin of the cucumbers, leaving some skin on to create stripes. Then, slice them thinly into rounds.
4. Sprinkle the salt on the slices and gently massage it in. Set aside for 5 minutes. The salt helps draw out the moisture from the cucumbers (so it does not dilute the salad dressing after mixing).
5. Squeeze out the liquid from the rehydrated wakame seaweed and cucumbers. Add them to the bowl with the dressing and toss it all together.
