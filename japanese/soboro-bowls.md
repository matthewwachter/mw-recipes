## Instructions
1. Get the rice cookin
2. Ground Chicken
    1. Heat oil in a non-stick frying pan on medium heat, and cook the chicken until no longer pink. Using a wooden spoon, break up the meat into small pieces.
    2. Add sake, sugar, and mirin.
    3. Add soy sauce and continue to break up the meat into smaller pieces.
    4. Grate ginger and keep the juice. When the meat is broken up to pieces, add the ginger with juice.
    5. Cook until the liquid is almost gone. Transfer to a bowl and set aside and wash the frying pan.
3. Scrambled Eggs
    1. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and add sugar. Mix well until sugar is completely dissolved. Prepare several long cooking chopsticks.
    2. Heat oil in the frying pan over medium-low heat and pour in the egg mixture.
    3. Hold several chopsticks in one hand and break the egg into small pieces. When it’s cooked, transfer to another bowl.

## Notes
- Crack a quail egg on top after assembling meat and egg over rice.
- The other add-ons are great but some are rather non-traditional. Personally I think they all go well together but some might disagree.
