## Ingredients
- Ground Chicken
    - 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)
    - 1/2 lb ground chicken (if you can't get ground chicken, you can mince fattier thigh (or mix with breast) with a knife or use a food processor.)
    - 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice)
    - 1 Tbsp sake
    - 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar (typically, this dish has a sweet taste, but you can use 1 Tbsp sugar if you prefer less sweet.)
    - 1 Tbsp mirin
    - 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- Scrambled Eggs
    - 2 Large Eggs
    - 1 Tbsp Sugar
    - 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil
- Short grain rice
- Add-ons
    - Quail Egg
    - Green Peas
    - Pickled red ginger
    - Fukujinzuke
    - Kimchi

## Instructions
1. Get the rice cookin
2. Ground Chicken
    1. Heat oil in a non-stick frying pan on medium heat, and cook the chicken until no longer pink. Using a wooden spoon, break up the meat into small pieces.
    2. Add sake, sugar, and mirin.
    3. Add soy sauce and continue to break up the meat into smaller pieces.
    4. Grate ginger and keep the juice. When the meat is broken up to pieces, add the ginger with juice.
    5. Cook until the liquid is almost gone. Transfer to a bowl and set aside and wash the frying pan.
3. Scrambled Eggs
    1. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and add sugar. Mix well until sugar is completely dissolved. Prepare several long cooking chopsticks.
    2. Heat oil in the frying pan over medium-low heat and pour in the egg mixture.
    3. Hold several chopsticks in one hand and break the egg into small pieces. When itâ€™s cooked, transfer to another bowl.

## Notes
- Crack a quail egg on top after assembling over rice.
- The other add-ons are great but some are rather non-traditional. Personally I think they all go well together but some might disagree.
