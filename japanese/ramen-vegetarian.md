## Instructions
1. Gather all the ingredients. Please note that the serving size is one for this recipe. You can scale the recipe to multiply the ingredients for the number of servings you wish to prepare.
### To Make the Vegetarian Dashi (Kombu + Shiitake)
1. Soak the kombu and dried shiitake mushroom in the measured water for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the liquid, kombu, and shiitake to a small saucepan. Slowly bring the liquid to a boil over low heat. This will help enhance the dashi flavor.
2. Right before the liquid reaches a full boil, remove the kombu and shiitake mushroom from the dashi. If you leave the kombu in the liquid, the dashi will become slimy. Turn off the heat and set aside.
### To Make the Soup Broth
1. Grind and crush the sesame seeds in a Japanese mortar and pestle (suribachi and surikogi like this).
2. Mince the garlic (I used a garlic press) and the ginger.
3. Separate the green and white parts of the scallion, and then cut into thin rounds.
4. Set a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Once hot, add the sesame oil. Then, add the garlic, ginger, and white part of the scallion and cook until fragrant.
5. Add the doubanjiang (spicy chili bean sauce/broad bean paste) and miso to the saucepan. Stir constantly so that they don’t burn.
6. Add the sake and use a wooden spatula to stir and release the bits of the sauce attached to the bottom of the saucepan.
7. Add the ground sesame seeds and soy sauce.
8. Gradually add the soy milk, stirring constantly and making sure to dissolve the doubanjiang and miso. Then, add the kombu and shiitake dashi.
9. Add a dash of white pepper and salt to taste. Turn off the heat and set aside.
### To Assemble
1. Once the soup and all the toppings are prepared, cook the fresh or dried ramen noodles in boiling water according to the package instructions. (Do not overcook the noodles; I usually cook 30-60 seconds less than specified.) Make sure to loosen the noodles before adding them to the boiling water and stir the noodles so that they don’t stick to each other. Reheat the soup broth at the same time.
2. Once the noodles are cooked, drain them very well and transfer them to a ramen bowl. Pour the hot soup broth into the bowl.
3. Place the toppings of your choice on the ramen and enjoy!
