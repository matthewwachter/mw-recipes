## Ingredients
- 1 medium daikon radish, peeled
- 1/2 English cucumber, halved lengthwise, inner seeds scooped out
- 1/2 small lotus root, peeled and sliced crosswise
- 2-inch knob fresh ginger, peeled
- 1 small carrot
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup mirin
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 piece kombu (kelp)

## Instructions
1. Slice the daikon, cucumber, lotus root, ginger, and carrot, and then cut them into relatively equal small strips or half moons. Transfer them to a large bowl. Season with salt, and mix to combine. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, and sugar in a medium saucepan.
3. Rinse the salted vegetables, and squeeze out any excess water. Add them to the pot, and bring the marinade to a low boil.
4. Remove the pan from the heat, and let it cool. Transfer the pickle to an airtight container along with the kombu. Store it in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before serving.
