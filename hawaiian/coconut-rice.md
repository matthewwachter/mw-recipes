## Notes
- Unsweetened Coconut Milk is located in the Asian food aisle at your local grocery store.  Note that this is not the same as coconut water found in the refrigerated section.
- Instant Pot Coconut Rice: Use 2 cups jasmine rice, 2 cups coconut milk, and Â½ cup water (along with the salt and brown sugar called for in the recipe). Add all ingredients to the pressure cooker and stir to combine. Cook on high pressure (manual) for 4 minutes. Allow a 10 minute natural release (the valve may release sooner than that but allow the rice to sit for 10 full minutes).
- Coconut Lime Rice: Replace 2 Tablespoons of the water with lime juice and cook according to recipe instructions.
- Rice Substitutions:
    - Basmati Coconut Rice: Substitute equal amount with no other changes.
    - Long-Grain White Rice: Substitute equal amount with no other changes.
    - Brown Rice: Follow same instructions but cook for 50 minutes instead of 15.
