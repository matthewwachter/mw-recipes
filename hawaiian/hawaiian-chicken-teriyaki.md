## Ingredients
- 6 chicken tenders (or 3 chicken breasts)
- 2 zucchini , sliced
- 2 bell peppers , any color, chopped
- 1/2 pineapple , peeled and cut into spears
- 1 red onion , sliced thin
- 1 batch [Coconut Rice](coconut-rice.md)

Teriyaki Sauce:
- ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 Tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 Tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/4 cup + 1 Tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 Tablespoon honey
- ¾ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 clove garlic , minced
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch+ 2 tsp water , mixed together to make a cornstarch slurry
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

## Instructions
1. Make the [Coconut Rice](coconut-rice.md).
2. Make the teriyaki sauce by adding all of the sauce ingredients to a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and boil for about 1 minute. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.
3. Pour ¼ cup of the teriyaki sauce over the raw chicken and set aside to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or longer if using chicken breasts).
4. Preheat a grill or grill pan. If you have a vegetable grill basket to grill the vegetables in, then chop them and grill them in the basket. If not, cut the vegetables into large pieces that will not fall through the grill grates.
5. Drizzle some olive oil over the vegetables and over the pineapple spears. Grill the vegetables for just a few minutes on each side and then remove to a plate. 
6. Grill the pineapple next by placing the pineapple spears directly on the grill. Grill for about 2 minutes on each side, and remove to a plate. 
7. Lastly, place the chicken on the grill. Cook for about a few minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Remove to a plate to rest before slicing.
8. To Assemble: Add coconut rice to each serving bowl. Top with grilled veggies, pineapple and chicken.  Drizzle teriyaki sauce on top.
