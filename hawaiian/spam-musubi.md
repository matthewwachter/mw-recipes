# Spam Musubi

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- ½ teaspooon mirin (optional)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons neutral oil, like canola or vegetable
- 1 (12-ounce) can Spam, cut horizontally into 8 slices
- 3 sheets roasted sushi nori, cut into thirds crosswise
- 2 teaspoons furikake
- 5 to 6 cups cooked short-grain white rice

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, sugar and mirin (if using). Set aside.
2. Lightly coat the bottom of a large skillet with oil and heat over medium. Fry the Spam slices until evenly browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Turn off the heat. Working quickly to avoid burning, add the soy mixture and turn the Spam slices until evenly coated in glaze. Immediately transfer the Spam slices and glaze to a plate.
3. To mold the musubi, start by placing a strip of nori, rough side up, on a cutting board or clean work surface. Place a Spam musubi maker mold over it, in the middle, then place a slice of Spam into the mold. (If you don’t have a mold, you can line a clean Spam can with plastic wrap instead, and place a slice of Spam at the bottom.) Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon furikake over the Spam, then fill the mold or can with a generous mound of rice. Press the rice firmly with the musubi maker press or with your hands until it is 3/4- to 1-inch thick, adding more rice as needed.
4. Use the press to hold the rice down with one hand and pull the mold upward to unmold the musubi with your other hand. (If you’re using the Spam can, gently lift the Spam and rice out of the can by gently pulling on both sides of the plastic wrap.) Wrap the nori around the Spam-rice stack, bringing both ends of the strip to the middle, folding one over the other, and flipping it over so the seam is down and the Spam is facing up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately or wrap with plastic wrap to take with you on the go.

## Notes
- Stan's Method: you slice the spam and fry it, meanwhile take the just-made rice from the cooker and fluff it around while mixing furikake of your choice in. wash the empty spam can out. with the fried spam slices to the side of your workspace, add rice into the spam can, squirt some tonkatsu sauce on top (just a little). then grab a spam slice and use it to push the rice down in until it feels like you've made it a nice block. flip the can over and rap it on the cutting board to free everything out onto a half sheet of nori and roll that thang up. Because you're using the can as your mold your rice and spam match up perfectly every time.
