2. THE NIGHT BEFORE: Soak sweet rice in water for 3-4 hrs or more.
3. NEXT MORNING: Strain soaked sweet rice through a colander and remove all excess water.
4. Grind sweet rice with a blender or chopper as fine as you can make it. Set aside.
5. Strain malt barley through a fine sieve or medium grade cheese cloth to just get the liquid and some fine white sediments.
6. Add sweet rice powder to strained liquid from above.
7. Leave mixture in the oven with a temperature of about 60°C (140°F) for 5 hrs.
8. Remove malt barley + sweet rice mixture from oven and cook on stove top.
9. Start at medium high -> medium heat until liquid has reduced by about 20%. Let it cool.
10. Once liquid is cooled, add fine gochukaru, meju karu and sea salt.
11. Add rice syrup (jocheong 조청) – add more or less to your taste.
12. Mix everything well.
13. Transfer gochujang into the prepared, sanitized clay pot (hangari 항아리).
14. Sprinkle top with handful of sea salt.
15. Leave in full sun for 6 months.

## Notes
- You should really just buy this at a store.
- The sun helps to kill any fungus from forming on top. Cover the top with a fine mosquito net or mesh that will keep the bugs away but let the sun in. Tie the net with a string so it stays put. Cover with a lid when it rains and at night time to keep moisture out.
