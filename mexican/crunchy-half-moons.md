# Crunchy Half Moons

## Source
The mid west

## Ingredients
- 1 lb Beef
- Lawry's Taco Mix
- Corn Tortillas
- Oil (olive or veg)
- Sour Cream
- Lime
- Romaine Lettuce
- Mexican Cheese
- Salsa
- Guac
- Hot Sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Make the taco meat as per the instructions on the Lawry's packet.
3. Make "Crema" by mixing lime juice into some sour cream.
4. Chop Romain pretty fine.
5. Coat tortillas in oil and place in oven directly on rack so that each tortilla is supported by 2 things in the middle. Cook for about 9 minutes give or take. Definitely put a baking sheet on the rack below to catch the oil drips.
6. Assemble and consume.

## Notes
- Obviously you can just buy crunchy shells from the store but they're pretty easy to make in the oven.
- Goes nice with pickled red onion.
