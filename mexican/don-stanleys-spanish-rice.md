"its not a recipe so much as a method"

## Ingredients
- 1 Cup Long Grain White Rice
- Caldo de Tomate
- Caldo de Pollo
- Sazon Goya
- El Pato
- Onion
- Celery
- Tomato
- Bell pepper
- Carrot

## Instructions
1. 1 dry cup of long grain rice gets dry fried in some vegetable oil
heat oil first, until it shimmers, rice in, keep it moving
2. when rice is starting to get a little colored, in goes coarsely cubed up stuff - usually like one carrot, a couple celery ribs, half an onion, a bell pepper, 2 roma tomatoes. keep that moving for a second
3. when the rice is starting to maybe be about to burn, toss in 1 packet sazon goya, like a tablespoon each of knorr caldo de pollo and knorr caldo de tomate. whip that shit real quick before you actually burn rice
4. then add in liquid. liquid is you take a little can of el pato hot tomato sauce, put it into a measuring cup, then add water until you have 2 cups of liquid total. add that in and stir good when adding the liquid. clap a lid on the pot
5. as soon as you have confirmed you've reached a boil, heat goes to absolute lowest setting for like 20-25min
6. remove from heat and do absolutely nothing for a solid 10min or so
    dont fluff
    dont fuck with it
    just wait
7. after that, jangle it around to make sure all the veg that floated to the top is evenly distributed
thats about it

## Notes
- This is sort of loose, like sometimes i dont use the knorr caldo de pollo e.g. if i'm making it vegetarian
- Sometimes i use chicken or veg stock instead of water in the liquids mix
- The vegetable amounts are sorta vague and sometimes i dont use all those things
- The sazon goya, caldo de tomate, and el pato are extremely key ingredients. Those absolutely cannot be omitted.
