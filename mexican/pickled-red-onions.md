1. Place jalepeño and onions in a medium mixing bowl. 
2. Heat vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a small skillet over high heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil, then pour over onions. Press onions down with a spoon until submerged.
3. Place a double layer of paper towels on top of onions and press down until completely saturated in liquid to keep onions submerged.
