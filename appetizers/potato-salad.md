# Potato Salad

## Source

## Ingredients
- Potatoes- Yukon Gold or red skinned potatoes. whatever looks good at the supermarket. I'm partial to the red ones
- Mayo (a lot, see below)
- Dijon mustard
- Dill relish
- Fresh Dill
- Red onion
- Celery
- Paprika
- Hard boiled eggs (if you are feeling midwestern. Honestly I do it this way about once every other year but it can be tasty)
- Salt and Pepper

## Instructions
1. Wash the potatoes with a vegetable brush. take out the eyes with a peeler corer and partially peel them. the skins are really good in the salad but can be overwhelming if the potatoes are small. So, for smaller potatoes peel more, for larger, peel only about 1/3 off. I kind of randomly stripe mine. Chop them into 2" chunks and boil in salted water until soft when pierced with a knife (soft to the center, but not mushy, or then you go full mashed potatoes at the end).
2. Drain and cool with running water in a colander to stop the cooking. Put aside.
3. Chop onion and celery into very small pieces- I recommend "de-stringing" the celery as well-- run the peeler very lightly over the rounded side of the celery which should take off only hairlike fibrous bits, this reduces any stringiness in the small pieces. 
4. If using eggs, peel and chop into small pieces.
5. Mix all that into the cooled potatoes. Mix mix mix.
6. Now, while nobody is looking, add a lot of mayo to this. Like go past when you think you should. It'll look gross but itll combine. Now, do about 1/4 of that volume with dijon mustard. Mix.
7. Add a splash of cider vinegar and mix in. You should just be able to tell that the scent of the dish has changed if you sniff it. Don't make it like huffing the jar. That's too much. Use a light hand.
8. Add just enough relish such that each bite should have a little in it- you should see flecks evenly dispersed in the mix.
9. Mix in salt and pepper and paprika to taste
10. Garnish with finely chopped fresh dill, cover and cool until time to serve

## Notes
- I almost always make this either A) drunk  B) about to be drunk or C) as the sole side dish to a bbq so i can claim we ate something other than slabs of meat. This means that the texture and content of this recipe has varied wildly, but I honestly prefer it coming out with the texture of cold mashed potatoes. I'm bad at cooking potatoes, so sue me. Feel free to cook them less and end up with a more classic, chunky style while using my workup.
