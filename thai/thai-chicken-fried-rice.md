[Classic Thai Chicken Fried Rice](https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-thai-chicken-fried-rice-3217140)

## Ingredients
- 4 to 5 cups cooked rice, preferably several days old
- 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, or 2 thighs, chopped into small pieces
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce, more to taste
- 1 tablespoon lime juice, more to taste
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper, or black pepper
- 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 spring onions, sliced, white and green parts separated
- 3 to 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red or green chile pepper, thinly sliced, or a sprinkling of chile flakes
- 5 to 7 fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and chopped into small pieces
- 1 small stalk celery, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1 large egg
- Thai sweet chile sauce, for serving, optional

## Instructions
1. Gather the ingredients.
2. If using leftover cold rice, drizzle a teaspoon or two of oil on your fingers and work through the rice, separating clumps back into grains.
3. Place the chopped chicken in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce. Stir well and set aside.
4. Combine the chicken stock, fish sauce, remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, and white pepper. Set aside.
5. Heat a wok or large frying pan over high or medium-high heat. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of oil and swirl around, then add the white parts of the spring onions plus the garlic and chile.
6. Stir-fry 1 minute, then add the chicken. Stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes, or until chicken turns evenly opaque.
7. Add the mushrooms and celery and stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes, until everything is cooked through (celery should stay a little crunchy). If your wok or pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil.
8. Keeping the heat high, add the rice. Stir-fry using a spatula or other flat utensil to gently lift and turn the rice.
9. Gradually begin adding the stir-fry sauce, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time. Continue stir-frying 6 to 10 minutes, or until all the sauce has been added.
10. Add frozen peas and stir to incorporate. Then push everything aside to reveal the center of the pan.
11. Crack in the egg and quickly stir-fry to scramble.
12. Continue stir-frying everything together over high heat 2 more minutes or until the rice is light and falls easily into separate grains.
13. Remove from heat and taste test, adding a little more fish sauce until the desired flavor is achieved. If too salty, add a squeeze of lime juice. Top with reserved green onion parts. For those who like it extra spicy, serve with Thai chile sauce on the side.



## Notes
- Avoid adding too much extra stock or other liquids when frying the rice, or your rice will become too heavy and lumpy.
