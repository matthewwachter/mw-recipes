## Ingredients
- 4-5 large potatoes, peeled
- 1 large onion, peeled
- 2 eggs
- 1/4-1/2 cup matzo meal (depending on how much liquid the potatoes and onions yield)
- Oil, such as grapeseed, avocado or canola, for frying
- Salt and white pepper, to taste
- Applesauce

## Instructions
1. Use the small openings on a box grater to grate the potatoes and onions (a food processor may also be used) into a large bowl.
2. Add 2 eggs, salt, white pepper and matzo meal and mix together.
3. Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Drop rounded tablespoons of the mixture into the oil and fry on each side until brown and crispy.
4. Remove potato pancakes from the oil with a slotted spatula and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.5.Serve with plain, with applesauce or cranberry applesauce, as desired.

## Notes
- Use the small opening on the grater to grate the potatoes, which provides more texture than using a food processor.
